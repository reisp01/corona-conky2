# corona-conky2
Coronavirus stats in conky, now with more formatting

This requires external script files, so it's messier than I'd like, but it does work. Uses bash's printf command with a single quote (') format, which (in the US at least) puts commas every three digits. So 3000000 is formatted as 3,000,000.
